I have created the following plan after thorough exploration and analysis of the codebase. Follow the below plan verbatim. Trust the files and references. Do not re-verify what's written in the plan. Explore only when absolutely necessary. First implement all the proposed file changes and then I'll review all the changes together at the end.

### Observations

I analyzed the current codebase and found that there's no existing theme system in place. The project uses React with TypeScript, Tailwind CSS, and follows a context pattern for state management (as seen in CartContext.tsx and AuthContext.tsx). The PRD specifies detailed color palettes for both light and dark themes, with specific requirements for CSS variables, smooth transitions, and a theme switcher.

### Approach

I'll implement a comprehensive theme system by:

1. Creating CSS variables in index.css for both light and dark themes with the exact colors from PRD
2. Building ThemeContext following the existing context pattern used in the codebase
3. Updating Tailwind config to use CSS variables as custom colors, enabling seamless integration
4. Adding smooth transitions with 0.3s duration as specified in PRD

This approach ensures the theme system is extensible, follows existing code patterns, and meets all PRD requirements including default light theme and smooth animations.

### Reasoning

I explored the repository structure and examined the current frontend setup. I read the PRD to understand the exact color requirements and theme specifications. I analyzed the existing context pattern by reviewing CartContext.tsx to ensure consistency. I confirmed there's no existing theme system, so I need to build it from scratch while following established patterns.

## Proposed File Changes

### frontend\src\index.css(MODIFY)

References: 

- PRD-frontend.md

Add CSS variables for the complete color palette as specified in PRD-frontend.md. Define :root with light theme colors as default, and [data-theme="dark"] selector for dark theme colors. Include all required colors: background, cards, text (primary and secondary), accent, and borders. Add smooth transition properties (transition: background-color 0.3s ease, color 0.3s ease, border-color 0.3s ease) to * selector for seamless theme switching animations. The CSS variables will follow the naming convention --color-bg, --color-card, --color-text, --color-text-secondary, --color-accent, --color-border to be easily referenced in Tailwind config.

### frontend\src\contexts\ThemeContext.tsx(NEW)

References: 

- frontend\src\contexts\CartContext.tsx

Create a new ThemeContext following the same pattern as CartContext.tsx. Define ThemeContextType interface with theme (light/dark), toggleTheme function, and setTheme function. Implement ThemeProvider component that manages theme state using useState with 'light' as default (as specified in PRD). Add useLocalStorage hook integration to persist theme preference. Include useEffect to apply the theme by setting data-theme attribute on document.documentElement. Export useTheme hook with proper error handling similar to useCart hook pattern. The context will handle all theme switching logic and DOM manipulation for CSS variable application.

### frontend\tailwind.config.js(MODIFY)

References: 

- frontend\src\index.css(MODIFY)
Extend the Tailwind theme configuration to include custom colors that reference the CSS variables defined in index.css. Add a colors object in the extend section with mappings like bg: 'var(--color-bg)', card: 'var(--color-card)', text: 'var(--color-text)', 'text-secondary': 'var(--color-text-secondary)', accent: 'var(--color-accent)', and border: 'var(--color-border)'. This will enable using classes like bg-bg, text-text, border-border throughout the application while automatically respecting the current theme through CSS variables.

### frontend\src\App.tsx(MODIFY)

References: 

- frontend\src\contexts\ThemeContext.tsx(NEW)

Wrap the existing application with the new ThemeProvider component. Import ThemeProvider from ./contexts/ThemeContext and ensure it wraps all other providers and components. This integration should follow the same pattern used for other context providers in the application. The ThemeProvider should be placed at the top level to ensure theme context is available throughout the entire application component tree.
